                    <h2>Properties of Circle </h2> <br>
                    Some of the important properties of the circle are as follows: <br><br>

                    ^ The circles are said to be congruent if they have equal radii<br>
                    ^ The diameter of a circle is the longest chord of a circle<br>
                    ^ Equal chords of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre<br>
                    ^ The radius drawn perpendicular to the chord bisects the chord<br>
                    ^ Circles having different radius are similar<br>
                    ^ A circle can circumscribe a rectangle, trapezium, triangle, square, kite<br>
                    ^ A circle can be inscribed inside a square, triangle and kite<br>
                    ^ The chords that are equidistant from the centre are equal in length<br>
                    ^ The distance from the centre of the circle to the longest chord (diameter) is zero<br>
                    ^ The perpendicular distance from the centre of the circle decreases when the length of the chord increases<br>
                    ^ If the tangents are drawn at the end of the diameter, they are parallel to each other<br>
                    ^ An isosceles triangle is formed when the radii joining the ends of a chord to the centre of a circle<br>
